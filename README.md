# Accessibility Persona Card Website

This project is an inclusive persona card website designed for a **high school student with autism and color blindness**, with a strong focus on accessibility, readability, and reduced cognitive load.

The website applies established accessibility guidelines and reflects critically on existing persona design frameworks to propose improvements for users with autism and/or color blindness.

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Design an accessible interface tailored to the needs of a neurodiverse persona
* Reduce sensory overload and improve content comprehension
* Allow users to customize visual aspects according to their needs
* Critically evaluate and refactor an existing persona framework

## 🧠 Key Features

* Adjustable **font size**, **letter spacing**, and **margins**
* Customizable **color schemes** to support color blindness and sensory sensitivity
* Simple layout with minimal animations and distractions
* Change the standard colour styles (e.g. high contrast and dark mode) and options for people with colour blindness (e.g. deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia, greyscale).
* Literal and clear language, avoiding metaphors and colloquialisms

## 🧩 Persona Framework

This project is based on **Persona Cards by Vivian Motti**, but goes further by:

* Critically reflecting on the limitations of traditional persona cards
* Refactoring the framework to better support **sensory, cognitive, and accessibility needs**
* Emphasizing adaptability and user control over static persona representations
